# Tekton Pipelines

Tekton Pipelines is an open source implementation to configure and run CI/CD
style pipelines for your Kubernetes application.

Pipeline creates
[Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
as building blocks to declare pipelines.

A custom resource is an extension of Kubernetes API which can create a custom
[Kubernetes Object](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#understanding-kubernetes-objects).
Once a custom resource is installed, users can create and access its objects
with kubectl, just as they do for built-in resources like pods, deployments etc.
These resources run on-cluster and are implemented by
[Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions).

High level details of this design:

- [Pipelines](pipelines.md) do not know what will trigger them, they can be
  triggered by events or by manually creating [PipelineRuns](pipelineruns.md)
- [Tasks](tasks.md) can exist and be invoked completely independently of
  [Pipelines](pipelines.md); they are highly cohesive and loosely coupled
- [Tasks](tasks.md) can depend on artifacts, output and parameters created by
  other tasks.
- [Tasks](tasks.md) can be invoked via [TaskRuns](taskruns.md)
- [PipelineResources](resources.md) are the artifacts used as inputs and outputs
  of Tasks.

## Usage

- [How do I create a new Pipeline?](pipelines.md)
- [How do I make a Task?](tasks.md)
- [How do I make Resources?](resources.md)
- [How do I control auth?](auth.md)
- [How do I run a Pipeline?](pipelineruns.md)
- [How do I run a Task on its own?](taskruns.md)
